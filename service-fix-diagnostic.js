/**
 * Service Request Filtering Bug Fix Summary
 * ==========================================
 * 
 * BUG IDENTIFIED:
 * In the getAvailableRequests method, the query was showing ALL unassigned requests 
 * to ALL doctors regardless of whether they offered the requested service.
 * 
 * Original problematic code:
 * { doctor: null } // This showed ALL unassigned requests to ALL doctors
 * 
 * SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
 * 1. Added service filtering to only show unassigned requests for services the doctor offers
 * 2. Added filtering to exclude requests that the doctor has already declined
 * 3. Added better logging to track request breakdown
 * 
 * Changes made in: /src/api/service-request/controllers/service-request.js
 * Method: getAvailableRequests (around line 1215)
 * 
 * KEY CHANGES:
 * 1. Fetch doctor's services first
 * 2. Filter unassigned requests by service compatibility:
 *    - { service: null } // Legacy requests without service
 *    - { service: { id: { $in: doctorServiceIds } } } // Only services doctor offers
 * 3. Exclude declined requests:
 *    - { declinedByDoctors: { id: { $ne: doctorId } } }
 * 4. Added service population for better debugging
 * 
 * TESTING:
 * To test this fix:
 * 1. Create service requests for different services
 * 2. Check that doctors only see requests for services they offer
 * 3. Verify declined requests don't appear again for the same doctor
 * 
 * The cron job broadcasting was already working correctly - it properly filters
 * doctors by service when creating duplicate requests for other doctors.

## Problem
Doctors were receiving service requests for all services, even if they didn't offer those specific services.

## Root Cause
In the \`getAvailableRequests\` method, the query \`{ doctor: null }\` was returning ALL unassigned requests to ALL doctors, regardless of service compatibility.

## Solution
Modified the query to:
1. Filter unassigned requests by services the doctor actually offers
2. Exclude requests the doctor has already declined
3. Maintain existing functionality for assigned requests

## Files Changed
- \`/src/api/service-request/controllers/service-request.js\`
- Method: \`getAvailableRequests\`

## Test Scenario
${JSON.stringify(testCase, null, 2)}

## Verification Steps
1. Restart Strapi server
2. Create service requests for different services
3. Check that doctors only see requests matching their services
4. Verify declined requests don't reappear
